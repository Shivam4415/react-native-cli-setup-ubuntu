# react-native-cli-setup-ubuntu
Set Up react-native cli in ubuntu 20 

So, if you are here it means after searching lot of stuff on google you came to this repo or you want to set up android-cli in your ubuntu but not windows.
Never mind!! 
This Article is written on 12th November 2021 and Android-cli is setup and running. In future if you are facing some problems, feel free to drop comments , I will create a new version of this setup.

I will first dicuss the steps using bullet points, then we will go through actual setup. 
Step - 1 ::
 1. We need JDK setup.
 2. Adding its path in ~/.bashrc file.
 3. We will download Android CLI ZIP.
 4. Create a directory to extract and installed  PTN :: using a manual procedure as discussed below.
 5. We will also create lot of folders to do above operations.
 6. By lot of folders, I mean only two. LOL.
 7. At last but important we will path for android home, cmdline, tools etc etc in our BASHSRC file.
Seems a lot of stuff. Oh its pretty easier. Hang on for next 20 min, and after that you will have a heavenly feeling once done.


Lets start start start !!!!!!
